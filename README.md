# Different Approaches for Finding Local Alignments
Bioinformatics assignment from my third year of university. This assignment consists of implementing three algorithms for finding local alignments of two strings:

* A naive dynamic programming apporach, that runs in quadratic time and space.
* A linear space dynamic programming apporach.
* A Heuristic procedure that runs in sub-quadratic time.
